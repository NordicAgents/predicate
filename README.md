# Predicate

**Reasoning memory for AI agents — a self-improving knowledge graph that grows with use.**

*Every fact carries its provenance. Every answer carries its derivation. The schema sharpens itself the more your agent uses it.*

## What is Predicate?

Most agent "memory" is a flat pile of text: the model re-reads it and takes it
on faith — no record of where a fact came from, no guarantee the same question
answers the same way twice, and no signal when two notes contradict each other.
It never gets smarter; it just gets bigger.

Predicate is different. It stores facts as RDF triples with per-triple
provenance and confidence, and answers questions through a deterministic
reasoner that produces an explanation path for every derived claim. And it
**learns its own shape**: the schema is versioned like code and evolves under a
propose → validate → use-gated promotion loop, so the structure your agent
relies on gets sharper the more it's used — and prunes what it doesn't.

The bet is **not** that a graph recalls facts better than a long context window —
at the scales we've measured ([`predicate-eval/SCALE-FINDINGS.md`](packages/predicate-eval/SCALE-FINDINGS.md)),
in-context recall is competitive and often simpler. The bet is that a graph makes
answers **auditable, reproducible, and contradiction-aware** in a way a flat pile
can't.

## Why it's different

- **Auditable answers.** `kg_explain` returns the chain of triples and rules
  that produced a claim — each step cited back to its source and confidence.
  Not "trust me," but "here's the derivation."
- **Contradictions surface instead of averaging out.** When two sources
  disagree about a fact the schema marks functional or disjoint, the reasoner
  flags the conflict rather than silently picking one.
- **The graph remembers, and the schema earns its keep.** Facts persist across
  sessions. New schema becomes durable only after real queries reference it
  within a TTL — unused proposals expire on their own, so the graph can't thrash.
- **Goal-conditioned growth.** Concepts enter the graph because a goal needed
  them, not because a document mentioned them.

## Install / use it in your agent

> **Prerequisite: Node 20+.** Nothing else — no Docker, no database to run.

The fastest path is the `predicate-skill` npm package, which bundles the MCP
server, the `predicate` CLI, and per-client integration adapters.

<details open>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong> — one-command marketplace install</summary>

```
/plugin marketplace add NordicAgents/predicate
/plugin install predicate@predicate
```

Restart Claude Code (or `/reload-plugins`), then:

```bash
predicate up        # creates the local store + the 8 named graphs
predicate doctor    # all checks green
```

Hooks, slash commands, and the `kg_*` tools are wired automatically. Slash
commands: `/predicate:up`, `/predicate:down`, `/predicate:status`,
`/predicate:ask <question>`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex CLI</strong> (native plugin, capture supported)</summary>

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add NordicAgents/predicate
# then enable "predicate" in the interactive plugin browser
```

Set `[features] plugin_hooks = true` in `~/.codex/config.toml` and approve the
hooks once via `/hooks`. See `packages/predicate-skill/hooks/codex-cli/README.md`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Gemini CLI</strong> (extension, capture supported)</summary>

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/NordicAgents/predicate
# restart Gemini CLI
```

Installs as a self-contained extension (own MCP server, `GEMINI.md`, and
`SessionStart` / `AfterAgent` / `PreCompress` hooks). See
`packages/predicate-skill/hooks/gemini-cli/README.md`.

<summary><strong>VS Code Copilot</strong> / <strong>Cursor</strong> (MCP-only)</summary>

From your project root:

```bash
npx predicate-skill install vscode    # writes .vscode/mcp.json + AGENTS.md
npx predicate-skill install cursor    # writes .cursor/mcp.json + AGENTS.md
```

Restart the editor. Reasoning tools work; there is no automatic turn capture
(neither host exposes usable lifecycle hooks).

```bash
npm install -g predicate-skill

Continue.dev — in `~/.continue/config.yaml`:

  capture ──▶ kg_assert ──▶ reasoner materializes ──▶ kg:inferred ──▶ kg_ask / kg_explain
```

The agent reads the schema (`kg_explore_schema`), drafts SPARQL, asserts facts
with provenance (`kg_assert`), and asks questions (`kg_ask`). The reasoner does
the logic; the model formulates queries and interprets results.

## How it works

- **Storage.** 8 named graphs separate slow-changing schema (`kg:tbox`) from
  fast-flowing facts (`kg:abox`), materialized entailments (`kg:inferred`),
  per-triple metadata (`kg:provenance`), goals (`kg:goals`), usage logs
  (`kg:usage`), staging (`kg:tbox-staging`), and version history (`kg:meta`).
- **Reasoning.** A curated set of **21 rules — 16 OWL 2 RL rules plus 5 domain
  and judgment derivations** (`Hotspot`, `FlakyCommand`, `ActiveFile`,
  current-judgment, conflict detection). The entailment rules run as SPARQL
  `CONSTRUCT` forward-chained to a fixpoint; disjointness is checked as an
  inconsistency pass; SHACL shapes add closed-world validation. The OWL 2 RL
  coverage is a scoped subset — in v1, `owl:propertyChainAxiom` is limited to
  length-2 chains and `owl:hasKey` to single-property keys.
- **Provenance.** Every triple is annotated with source, time, confidence, and
  extraction method using RDF-star. Low-confidence triples stay visible to
  queries but are excluded from the inference closure, so they cannot poison
  entailment.
- **Schema lifecycle.** The agent proposes deltas to `kg:tbox-staging`, never to
  `kg:tbox` directly. A proposal is promoted only after the reasoner accepts it
  and it has been referenced by N successful queries inside a TTL; unused
  proposals expire quietly.
- **Cross-session continuity.** A Stop hook extracts typed triples from each turn
  — files modified, commands that passed or failed — into `kg:abox`. The reasoner
  derives `Hotspot`, `FlakyCommand`, and `ActiveFile` so the next session can
  ask "what's unstable here?" without re-reading the repo.
